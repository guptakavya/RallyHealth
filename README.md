Write a program that accepts an integer (N) and sequences of digits, and fills in 0 or more operators (+, -,
and * -- weâ€™re disallowing division for this exercise) to that sequence so that a mathematical expression is
generated that totals N. For example, consider the input sequence 2100100. Operators can be inserted
in a variety of ways that would evaluate to 2000.
